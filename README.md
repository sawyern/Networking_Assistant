Repo rules:

* Always use a helpful commit message
* Don't commit warnings or errors
* Don't push untested code (push to your personal branch instead)
* Do dev work on the dev branch (only merge with master when 100% complete)

* Comment your code/Write clean self documenting code
* No unnecessary white-space
* No magic numbers
